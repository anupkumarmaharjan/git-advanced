# The Computer Revolution/Timeline

## Nineteenth century

- 1837 - Charles Babbage designs the first programmable computer called
the "Analytical Engine". This was designed to use punch cards of the
type used in Jacquard looms. Ada Lovelace wrote a program for the
machine. The Analytical Engine is probably the first "Turing Complete"
computer design.
- 1847-1854 George Boole develops Boolean algebra which is the foundation
of the hardware design of all modern digital computers.
Mid-late nineteenth century mechanical and electromechanical adding
machines developed and widely used.

## The 20's

- 1920's - German Enigma Machine, an electromechanical rotor machine is
widely used to encrypt and decrypt secret messages. Although this was
not a computer, being more like an advanced adding machine, its role in
World War II stimulated computer design for decryption machines.
