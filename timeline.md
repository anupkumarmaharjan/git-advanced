# The Computer Revolution Timeline

## Nineteenth century

- 1837 - Charles Babbage designs the first programmable computer called
the "Analytical Engine". This was designed to use punch cards of the
type used in Jacquard looms. Ada Lovelace wrote a program for the
machine. The Analytical Engine is probably the first "Turing Complete"
computer design.
- 1847-1854 George Boole develops Boolean algebra which is the foundation
of the hardware design of all modern digital computers.
Mid-late nineteenth century mechanical and electromechanical adding
machines developed and widely used.

## The 20's

- 1920's - German Enigma Machine, an electromechanical rotor machine is
widely used to encrypt and decrypt secret messages. Although this was
not a computer, being more like an advanced adding machine, its role in
World War II stimulated computer design for decryption machines.

## The 30's
- 1936, May 28 - Alan Turing submits "On Computable Numbers, with an
Application to the Entscheidungsproblem"
- 1939, December 31 - Hewlett-Packard Company founded by William Hewlett
and David Packard although they didn't make any computers until 1966.

## The 40's
- 1941 - German engineer Konrad Zuse invents and builds the first
electronic programmable computer. It was called the Z3 and gave rise to
the Z4 in 1950.
- 1943 - Colossus, the first programmable digital electronic computer is
built by the British to decode German messages.
- 1949 - American physicists, An Wang and Way-Dong Woo create the pulse
transfer controlling device.
